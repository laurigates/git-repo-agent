# /blueprint:adr-validate

Validate Architecture Decision Records for relationship consistency, reference integrity, and domain conflicts.

**Usage**: `/blueprint:adr-validate [--report-only]`


## Execution

Execute complete ADR validation and remediation workflow:


### Step 1: Discover all ADRs

1. Check for ADR directory at `docs/adrs/`
2. If missing → Error: "No ADRs found in docs/adrs/"
3. Parse all ADR files: `ls docs/adrs/*.md`
4. Extract frontmatter for each ADR: number, id, created, modified, status, domain, supersedes, superseded-by, extends, relates-to


### Step 2: Validate reference integrity

For each ADR, validate:

1. **supersedes references**: Verify target exists, target status = "Superseded", target has reciprocal superseded-by
2. **extends references**: Verify target exists, warn if target is "Superseded"
3. **related references**: Verify all targets exist, warn if one-way links
4. **self-references**: Flag if ADR references itself
5. **circular chains**: Detect cycles in supersession graph
6. **Cross-workspace references** (v3.3.0+, manifests with `workspaces.role`):
   Recognise these reference forms in supersedes/extends/related fields:
   - `ADR-NNN` — local to the current workspace (existing behaviour).
   - `<workspace-path>/ADR-NNN` — points into a sibling/child workspace. Resolve
     by reading `<workspace-path>/docs/adrs/` from the monorepo root. Warn if
     the workspace is not listed in root `workspaces.children`.
   - `/ADR-NNN` — points at the monorepo root's ADR set. Resolve using the
     manifest's `workspaces.root_relative_path` (for child manifests) or the
     current directory (for root manifests).
   Unresolved cross-workspace refs are reported as warnings (not errors) so
   they do not block validation during migration.

See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md#validation-rules) for detailed checks.


### Step 2b: Detect ADR-number collisions and index drift

ADR numbers are chosen at branch time but only claimed at merge time, so two
in-flight ADR PRs can pick the same number and both land (issue #1585 — the FVH
infrastructure #2015 collision where two ADRs both claimed `0038`). Run the
deterministic guard:

```bash
bash ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/check-adr-numbers.sh --project-dir "$(pwd)"
```

It emits the structured `STATUS=` / `ISSUE_COUNT=` convention and reports four
classes (see [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md#validation-rules)):

- `duplicate_adr_number` (ERROR) — two files claim the same number, by `NNNN-title.md` **filename** or by a frontmatter `id: ADR-NNNN` claim. The message names the source (`basename` / `frontmatter`), so a claim from a file with no number in its name is legible.
- `adr_number_collision` (ERROR) — a working-tree ADR claims a number a **different** file already holds on the base ref (`origin/main`) — the pre-merge parallel-PR case, caught before the second PR merges.
- `adr_registry_mismatch` (ERROR) — a file claims `ADR-NNNN` but the manifest `id_registry` maps that number to a different path. The registry is the only arbiter resolving id → path unambiguously: two files can both *say* `ADR-0016`, only one can be registered. Silent with no manifest / no `id_registry`.
- `adr_missing_index_row` (WARN) — an ADR is missing from the directory's README index (how the `0038` collision went unnoticed for a week). Repair via Step 2c instead of re-warning.

**Multiple ADR directories** (issue #2129): the guard scans a directory *set* —
the real ADR-0016 collision had its claimants in `docs/adrs/` and
`docs/blueprint/adrs/`, which a single-directory scan cannot see. Precedence:
repeatable `--adr-dir <dir>`, else `validation.adr_dirs` from the **shared**
`validation` manifest block (issue #2128, read via
`blueprint-plugin/scripts/get-validation-config.sh` — do not add a second config
mechanism), else the default `docs/adrs` then `docs/adr` order. It emits
`ADR_DIRS=` (TAB-separated) and `ADR_DIR_COUNT=`; `ADR_DIR=`, `ADR_COUNT=` and
`INDEX=` keep their #1585 meanings.

Fold findings into the Step 4 report. `STATUS=ERROR` is a blocking collision:
renumber the newer ADR to the next free number (updating **both** its filename
and its frontmatter `id:`), then regenerate the index (Step 2c).


### Step 2c: Regenerate the ADR index

`adr_missing_index_row` is repairable — the hand-maintained table is what
rotted. Rebuild it from frontmatter:

```bash

# CI / read-only gate: non-zero exit when the on-disk index is out of date
bash ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/generate-adr-index.sh --project-dir "$(pwd)" --check


# Repair: rewrite the table in every resolved ADR directory
bash ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/generate-adr-index.sh --project-dir "$(pwd)"
```

Only the block between two marker comments is rewritten, so prose around it
survives:

```markdown
<!-- ADR-INDEX:START -->
| ADR | Title | Status |
| --- | ----- | ------ |
| [ADR-0016](0016-in-engine-ui.md) | In-engine UI | Accepted |
<!-- ADR-INDEX:END -->
```

One index per directory (`--index-file` overrides the `README.md` default), over
the same directory set and widened number collection as Step 2b — so an ADR
numbered only in frontmatter still gets a row. `--check` states per directory:

| State | Severity | Meaning |
|-------|----------|---------|
| `in_sync` | OK | On-disk block matches the generated one |
| `drifted` | ERROR (exit 1) | Regenerate — the index is stale |
| `markers_absent` | WARN (exit 0) | No marker pair yet; a write adopts them. Deliberately **not** a diff |
| `index_absent` | WARN (exit 0) | No index file yet; a write creates one |
| `no_adrs` | OK | Directory holds no numbered ADRs |

Write mode reports `written` / `unchanged` / `markers_inserted` /
`index_created`. When markers land in a README that already had a hand-written
table, delete that table — the generated block is authoritative.


### Step 3: Analyze domains

1. Group ADRs by domain field
2. For each domain with multiple "Accepted" ADRs → potential conflict flag
3. List untagged ADRs (not errors, but recommendations)


### Step 4: Generate validation report

Compile comprehensive report showing:
- Summary: Total ADRs, domain-tagged %, relationship counts, status breakdown
- Reference integrity: Supersedes, extends, related status (✅/⚠️/❌)
- Errors found: Broken references, self-references, cycles
- Warnings: Outdated extensions, one-way links
- Domain analysis: Conflicts and untagged ADRs


### Step 5: Handle --report-only flag

If `--report-only` flag present:
1. Output validation report from Step 4
2. Exit without prompting for fixes


### Step 6: Prompt for remediation (if interactive mode)

Ask user action via report to orchestrator:
- Fix all automatically (update status, add reciprocal links)
- Review each issue individually
- Export report to `docs/adrs/validation-report.md`
- Skip for now

Execute based on selection (see [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md#remediation-procedures)).


### Step 7: Update task registry

Update the task registry entry in `docs/blueprint/manifest.json`:

```bash
jq --arg now "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)" \
  --arg result "${VALIDATION_RESULT:-success}" \
  --argjson processed "${ADRS_VALIDATED:-0}" \
  '.task_registry["adr-validate"].last_completed_at = $now |
   .task_registry["adr-validate"].last_result = $result |
   .task_registry["adr-validate"].stats.runs_total = ((.task_registry["adr-validate"].stats.runs_total // 0) + 1) |
   .task_registry["adr-validate"].stats.items_processed = $processed' \
  docs/blueprint/manifest.json > tmp.json && mv tmp.json docs/blueprint/manifest.json
```

Where `VALIDATION_RESULT` is "success", "{N} warnings", or "failed: {reason}".


### Step 8: Report changes and summary

Report all changes made:
- Updated ADRs (status changes, added links)
- Remaining issues count
- Next steps recommendation


# blueprint-adr-validate REFERENCE


## Validation Rules


### Supersedes Validation
- Target file must exist
- Target status must be "Superseded"
- Target must have `superseded-by: ADR-{this}`
- Create error if any check fails


### Extends Validation
- Target file must exist (error if missing)
- Warn if target status is "Superseded"
- Cannot extend self


### Related Validation
- All referenced ADRs must exist (error if missing)
- Warn if link is one-way (target doesn't reference back)
- Cannot relate to self


### Error Conditions
- Self-reference: ADR relates to itself
- Circular chain: A supersedes B supersedes A
- Broken reference: Target ADR doesn't exist
- Inconsistent supersession: Supersedes but target not marked Superseded


### ADR-Number Collisions (issue #1585)

`scripts/check-adr-numbers.sh` guards the parallel-PR numbering race. ADR
numbers are chosen at branch time but claimed at merge time, so two in-flight
ADR PRs can pick the same number and both land (the FVH infrastructure #2015
collision: two ADRs both numbered `0038`). The check is deterministic and
emits the `=== ADR NUMBER AUDIT ===` / `STATUS=` / `ISSUE_COUNT=` convention.

| Type | Severity | Meaning |
|------|----------|---------|
| `duplicate_adr_number` | ERROR | Two files in the working tree lead with the same `NNNN-`. |
| `adr_number_collision` | ERROR | A working-tree ADR's number is already held by a **different** filename on the base ref (`origin/main`) — the pre-merge parallel-PR case. |
| `adr_missing_index_row` | WARN | An ADR file is not referenced from the ADR directory's `README.md` index. |

It resolves the ADR directory as `docs/adrs/` (blueprint canonical) or
`docs/adr/`, degrades to `STATUS=OK` when neither exists, and skips the base-ref
comparison (still checking duplicates + index) when `origin/main` is
unavailable. Flags:

- `--project-dir <path>` — repo root (default: cwd).
- `--base-ref <ref>` — collision comparison ref (default: `origin/main`).

Remediation for an ERROR: renumber the newer ADR to the next free sequential
number, rewrite its `# ADR-NNNN:` title, and backfill the README index row.


## Report Format

```
ADR Validation Report
====================

Summary:
- Total ADRs: N
- With domain tags: N (X%)
- With relationships: N
- Status breakdown:
  - Accepted: N
  - Proposed: N
  - Superseded: N

Reference Integrity:
✅ Supersedes: Valid
⚠️ Extends: N warnings
❌ Related: N errors

Errors Found:
- ADR-0005: supersedes ADR-0003 but ADR-0003 not marked "Superseded"

Domain Analysis:
⚠️ state-management: 2 Accepted (conflict)
  - ADR-0003: Redux
  - ADR-0012: Zustand
  → Recommendation: ADR-0012 should supersede ADR-0003

✅ api-design: Consistent

Untagged ADRs (consider adding domain):
- ADR-0001: Language Choice
```


## Remediation Procedures


### Fix All Automatically
For each error:
1. If supersession mismatch → Update target status to "Superseded", add `superseded-by`
2. If one-way link → Add reciprocal `related:` entry to target


### Review Each Issue
1. Show issue context: ADR-X says Y, but Z
2. Ask: "Yes fix", "Skip", "Stop reviewing"
3. Apply fixes selected by user


### Export Report
Write full validation report to `docs/adrs/validation-report.md` with timestamp


## Frontmatter Extraction

Safe extraction pattern (avoids reserved variables):
```bash
adr_status=$(head -50 "$file" | grep -m1 "^status:" | sed 's/^[^:]*:[[:space:]]*//')
adr_domain=$(head -50 "$file" | grep -m1 "^domain:" | sed 's/^[^:]*:[[:space:]]*//')
adr_supersedes=$(head -50 "$file" | grep -m1 "^supersedes:" | sed 's/^[^:]*:[[:space:]]*//')
```


## Tips
- Run after creating new ADRs
- Domain conflicts indicate decisions needing reconciliation
- Untagged ADRs are valid but harder to analyze
- Use `/blueprint:derive-plans` to create ADRs with proper relationships
